Her only companion was her grandfather, a grizzled man whose weathered face held the map of a thousand storms.  He taught her the language of the sea \u2013 the mournful cry of gulls, the rhythmic crash of waves, the subtle shift in the wind that foretold a tempest.\n",

The wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the lighthouse, and the waves, monstrous and frothing, crashed against the rocks below with terrifying force.  Grandpa, usually unflappable, felt a tremor of unease.  He\u2019d seen many storms, but this one felt\u2026 different.\n",
       "\n",
       "Midst the fury, a faint, rhythmic glow pulsed through the swirling mist.  Intrigued, and despite Grandpa's warnings, Elara climbed to the lantern room.  Through the driving rain, she saw it: a small, glowing boat, battling the waves with impossible grace.  It was crafted from what looked like polished sea glass, and its sail, a shimmering, opalescent membrane, billowed, defying the wind.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the boat neared, a figure, shimmering, like the boat, emerged, a woman, her,, hair like spun moonlight, her eyes like twin stars.  The woman smiled, a serene, otherworldly smile, and extended a hand, a hand that, as Elara touched it, sent a jolt of warmth through her, a feeling of profound peace.\n",
       "\n",
       "The woman spoke, her voice a whisper of the sea, \u201cThe storm, child, is not of this world. It is a tear from a fallen star.  We, the children of the tide, must mend it.\u201d\n",
