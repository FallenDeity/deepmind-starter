        "text": "Okay, here's a function in Python that checks if a year is a leap year based on the standard Gregorian calendar rules.\n\n**Leap Year Rules:**\n\n1.  A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n2.  However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is NOT a leap year.\n3.  But, if the year is divisible by 400, it IS a leap year.\n\nLet's translate these rules into code.\n\n```python\ndef is_leap(year):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules.\n\n  Args:\n    year: An integer representing the year.\n\n  Returns:\n    True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Rule 1: Check if divisible by 4\n  if year % 4 == 0:\n    # Rule 2: Check if divisible by 100\n    if year % 100 == 0:\n      # Rule 3: Check if divisible by 400 (exception to rule 2)\n      if year % 400 == 0:\n        return True  # Divisible by 400, so it's a leap year\n      else:\n        return False # Divisible by 100 but not 400, so not a leap year\n    else:\n      return True  # Divisible by 4 but not 100, so it's a leap year\n  else:\n    return False   # Not divisible by 4, so not a leap year\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n\nprint(f\"Is 2000 a leap year? {is_leap(2000)}\") # Expected: True (Divisible by 400)\nprint(f\"Is 1900 a leap year? {is_leap(1900)}\") # Expected: False (Divisible by 100 but not 400)\nprint(f\"Is 2024 a leap year? {is_leap(2024)}\") # Expected: True (Divisible by 4 but not 100)\nprint(f\"Is 2023 a leap year? {is_leap(2023)}\") # Expected: False (Not divisible by 4)\nprint(f\"Is 1600 a leap year? {is_leap(1600)}\") # Expected: True (Divisible by 400)\nprint(f\"Is 2100 a leap year? {is_leap(2100)}\") # Expected: False (Divisible by 100 but not 400)\n```\n\n**More Concise Version (using boolean logic):**\n\nYou can also combine the conditions into a single boolean expression:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_concise(year):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a given year is a leap year using a concise boolean expression.\n\n  Args:\n    year: An integer representing the year.\n\n  Returns:\n    True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\n\n# --- Example Usage (using the concise version) ---\nprint(\"\\nUsing concise version:\")\nprint(f\"Is 2000 a leap year? {is_leap_concise(2000)}\") # Expected: True\nprint(f\"Is 1900 a leap year? {is_leap_concise(1900)}\") # Expected: False\nprint(f\"Is 2024 a leap year? {is_leap_concise(2024)}\") # Expected: True\nprint(f\"Is 2023 a leap year? {is_leap_concise(2023)}\") # Expected: False\n```\n\nBoth functions implement the same logic and produce the correct results. The first version using nested `if/else` might be slightly easier to read for beginners, while the second version is more compact."

For this example, we'll assume it's in the same file.\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n# Assume the function you want to test is defined here (or imported)\ndef is_leap(year):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules.\n\n  Args:\n    year: An integer representing the year.\n\n  Returns:\n    True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Rule 1: Check if divisible by 4\n  if year % 4 == 0:\n    # Rule 2: Check if divisible by 100\n    if year % 100 == 0:\n      # Rule 3: Check if divisible by 400 (exception to rule 2)\n      if year % 400 == 0:\n        return True  # Divisible by 400, so it's a leap year\n      else:\n        return False # Divisible by 100 but not 400, so not a leap year\n    else:\n      return True  # Divisible by 4 but not 100, so it's a leap year\n  else:\n    return False   # Not divisible by 4, so not a leap year\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Unit Tests\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nclass TestIsLeapYear(unittest.TestCase):\n    \"\"\"\n    Test cases for the is_leap function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def test_divisible_by_4_not_by_100(self):\n        \"\"\"Years divisible by 4 but not by 100 should be leap years.\"\"\"\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(2024))\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(2020))\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(1996))\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(4)) # Test a small year\n\n    def test_divisible_by_100_not_by_400(self):\n        \"\"\"Years divisible by 100 but not by 400 should NOT be leap years.\"\"\"\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(1900))\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(2100))\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(1800))\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(100)) # Test a small year\n\n    def test_divisible_by_400(self):\n        \"\"\"Years divisible by 400 should be leap years.\"\"\"\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(2000))\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(1600))\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(2400))\n        self.assertTrue(is_leap(400)) # Test a small year\n\n    def test_not_divisible_by_4(self):\n        \"\"\"Years not divisible by 4 should NOT be leap years.\"\"\"\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(2023))\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(2025))\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(1999))\n        self.assertFalse(is_leap(1)) # Test a small year\n\n# This allows running the tests directly from the command line\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main(argv=['first-arg-is-ignored'], exit=False) # Added argv/exit for compatibility in some environments like notebooks\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`import unittest`**: Imports the necessary testing framework.\n2.  **`import is_leap`**: (If `is_leap` is in a separate file, e.g., `my_module.py`, you would use `from my_module import is_leap`).\n3.  **`class TestIsLeapYear(unittest.TestCase):`**: Creates a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This class will contain the individual test methods.\n4.  **`test_...` methods**: Each method starting with `test_` is automatically recognized by `unittest` as a test case.\n5.  **Docstrings**: The docstrings within the test methods explain what scenario each test is covering, which is good practice.\n6.  **Assertions**: Inside each test method, we use assertion methods provided by `unittest.TestCase`:\n    *   `self.assertTrue(expression)`: Asserts that the `expression` evaluates to `True`.\n    *   `self.assertFalse(expression)`: Asserts that the `expression` evaluates to `False`.\n    *   We call `is_leap()` with specific years that represent each rule of the leap year logic and assert the expected boolean result.\n7.  **`if __name__ == '__main__':`**: This block ensures that the `unittest.main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).\n8.  **`unittest.main()`**: This function discovers and runs the tests defined in classes inheriting from `unittest.TestCase` within the script.\n\n**How to Run the Tests:**\n\n1.  Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `test_leap_year.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4.  Run the command: `python test_leap_year.py`\n\nYou will see output indicating how many tests ran and whether they passed or failed. If all tests pass, it means your `is_leap` function is correctly implementing the standard Gregorian leap year rules for the test cases provided."
